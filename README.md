# print.lukasreis.com

A website where you can leave a small message and it will auto-print on my home printer!

---

## How This Works

You write a message on [print.lukasreis.com](https://print.lukasreis.com) and it gets sent directly to my home printer, a Brother DCP-7030.

### The Process

1. You type your message (up to 250 characters)
2. Hit "Send" and it goes into a queue
3. A Raspberry Pi at my place fetches for new messages
4. Your message gets printed on real paper
5. I read it!

### Some Rules

- One message per 5 minutes
- Keep it friendly, I'm a real person
- Messages are public and visible on the site

### Why?

I thought it would be fun. I've seen other people do this and I really wanted to make my own! It's like a guestbook, but nerdier.
